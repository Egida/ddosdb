                DDoSDB is a platform for helping victims of DDoS attacks, the academic community,
                and the security community to share and get access to actual and enriched information of DDoS attacks.
                The purpose of sharing attacks is to enable comparison with other attacks, facilitate legal attribution,
                and improve detection and mitigation strategies.

                DDosDB provides an interface for searching unique characteristics of attacks (fingerprints) and
                also provides a sample of its actual attack data (ex. pcap and nfdump file).
                All data within DDoSDB come from collaborators that own attack data (usually collected as a victim).
                We facilitate collaborators data sharing by providing an open source code that analyses an attack,
                generates fingerprints, and anonymizes the identity of the victim (<a href="https://github.com/jjsantanna/ddosdb" target="_blank">link</a>).
