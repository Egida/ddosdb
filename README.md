# DDoSDB repository
For the development of (1) a script to install a database that intend to store: DDoS attack fingerprints, anonymised network traces of DDoS attacks, and rules/signatures for detecting and mitigating DDoS attacks; (2) a script to connect a local DDoSDB with the public DDoSDB instance (at https://ddosdb.org); and (3) scripts for enriching the data within DDoSDB.
